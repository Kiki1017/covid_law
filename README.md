# COVID-19 mortality and demographic mortality laws

Christian Dudel, dudel@demogr.mpg.de

This repository contains code to fit various mortality laws to age-specific COVID-19 mortality ratios. The idea for this little project came from an exchange with Olivier Hardy and Tim Riffe. The code is preliminary and more a proof of concept.
